# ML_Cardiovascular_Risk_Prediction_Classification
This repository contains data prediction model through the Classification Algorithm.

Data Source : https://www.kaggle.com/code/bansodesandeep/cardiovascular-risk-prediction

I have explored four different models - Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier - to solve a classification problem by measuring accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score for each model. Surprisingly, the Decision Tree model performed the best on our training data. 

However, it's important to think about other things like cross-validation and trade-offs when choosing the best model. The decision should be based on what you specifically want and need, and on how each model behaves with new data, to make a smarter choice
